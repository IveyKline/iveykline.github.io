Ivey is a part of the Slavery, Freedom and (Un)Freedom Ph.D. cluster, and is broadly interested in histories of the United States South with a focus on Appalachia, histories of slavery and emancipation, and archival power. Her research explores the archive as a knowledge project that has produced an exclusionary narrative of the South. Before coming to IU, her work studied Georgianna Saunders a Black midwife in southwest Virginia during the early 20th century by placing Saunders within historical context and practices of power that attempted to silence her. Ivey is originally from Rockville, Virginia and received her B.A. in History from Roanoke College in Salem, Virginia. While at Roanoke she worked for the Center for Studying Structures of Race to co-create the Genealogy of Slavery project which sought to locate the names and narratives of enslaved people in Roanoke County. She also worked as the collections manager of the Maurice Berger Memorial Archive and Library
